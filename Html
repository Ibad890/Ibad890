Creating a website without a domain is possible, and you can do so by hosting it locally or using free hosting services. Hereâ€™s a simple guide on how to create a website without purchasing a domain:

1. Build the Website

You can create the website using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a simple example of a basic webpage:

index.html (HTML)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Simple Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Simple Website</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>This is a basic webpage built without a domain.</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 My Simple Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>

style.css (CSS)

body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

header {
    background-color: #333;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

section {
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

footer {
    background-color: #333;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px;
    position: fixed;
    width: 100%;
    bottom: 0;
}

2. Host Locally

If you just want to view your website on your own computer (locally), follow these steps:

Save the above code into two files: index.html and style.css in the same folder.

Open index.html in a web browser. You can now see your website, but it's only accessible on your computer.


3. Use Free Hosting Services

If you want to make your website accessible online without buying a domain, you can use free hosting services. Some options include:

GitHub Pages (For Static Websites)

1. Create a GitHub account at github.com.


2. Create a new repository and name it (e.g., my-simple-website).


3. Upload your website files (the index.html and style.css files).


4. Go to Settings > Pages in the repository.


5. Select the source branch (usually main or master) and save.


6. Your website will be live at https://username.github.io/repository-name.



Netlify (For Static Websites)

1. Go to Netlify.


2. Sign up using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.


3. Drag and drop your website folder (containing index.html and style.css) into the Netlify dashboard.


4. Your website will be deployed and live under a random subdomain like https://example.netlify.app.



Vercel (For Static Websites)

1. Go to Vercel.


2. Sign up and connect it with GitHub or GitLab.


3. Create a new project and upload your website files.


4. Vercel will deploy your site under a free subdomain like https://project-name.vercel.app.



4. Accessing the Website

Your website will be accessible at a subdomain provided by the hosting service. For example:

On GitHub Pages, it would be https://username.github.io/repository-name.

On Netlify, it might be https://your-site-name.netlify.app.

On Vercel, it would be something like https://your-site-name.vercel.app.


Summary

Build your website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Host it locally on your computer if you only want to view it privately.

Use free hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel to host your website without purchasing a domain. You'll get a free subdomain provided by these services.
